            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hello! I'm a passionate Roblox developer doing (anti-)cheat development and normal game development! I like learning about exploits and security systems. I have also made multiple websites, frontend and backend!</p>
            <p><b>My languages:</b> Lua(u) (Roblox), HTML/CSS/JS (frontend websites), Python (backend servers), and more.</p>

        <section class="websites">
            <h2>Frontend Websites I've Made</h2>
            <p>Multiple, but best for reference is <a href="https://github.com/Bjarnos/Bjarnos.github.io/" target="_blank">this</a>, the website you're looking at!</p>
        </section>

        <section class="backend">
            <h2>Backend Servers I've Made</h2>
            <p>Have you seen the Roblox games above? With their live stats? Of course, the client can't request that data from the Roblox API (due to CORS). <a href="https://github.com/Bjarnos/cv-server/">Here</a> is the backend server I fully wrote.</p>
