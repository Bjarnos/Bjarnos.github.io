            <div class="story"><p><b>Hello!</b> I'm a hobbyist Roblox developer doing (anti-)cheat development and normal game development! I like learning about exploits and security systems. I have also made multiple websites, frontend and backend!</p></div>
            <div class="story"><p><b>My languages:</b> Lua(u) (Roblox), HTML/CSS/JS (frontend websites), Python (backend servers), and more.</p></div>

            <div class="story"><p>Multiple, but best for reference is <a href="https://github.com/Bjarnos/Bjarnos.github.io/" target="_blank">this</a>, the source of the website you're looking at!</p></div>

        <section class="backend">
            <h2>Backend Servers I've Made</h2>
            <div class="story"><p>Have you seen the Roblox games above? With their live stats? Of course, the client can't request those data from the Roblox API (due to CORS). <a href="https://github.com/Bjarnos/cv-server/">Here</a> is the backend server I wrote for it. I have made others for other purposes (like discord bots) too.</p></div>

            <div class="story"><p>I usually work for free, and more as a friend than as an employee, although a gift (in robux) is much appreciated. I reserve the right for myself to decline jobs or to only do part of it (in consultation).</p></div>
